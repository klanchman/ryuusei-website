This update includes new features for voice actors, plus other improvements:

- Cast info for languages other than Japanese! Tap "View All" on a list of characters, then tap the speech bubble button to switch between the available dub languages for that anime.
- Multiple voice actors can now be shown for a single character in an anime (for example, when a second actor plays a younger version of a character)
- Fixed section headers on the Discover screen being slightly cut off on iOS 26
- Fixed Recommendations sometimes showing duplicate items
- Under-the-hood changes to how text labels throughout the app are set up
- Ryuusei now collects usage data with TelemetryDeck, a privacy-preserving analytics tool. This data will help me understand which features are used the most, and how I can improve everyone's experience with Ryuusei. Usage data is anonymized and is not tied to your AniList account or any other persistent identifiers. If you'd like to learn more, please check the updated [privacy policy]({{<ref "/legal/privacy" >}})
- If you live in a region with age verification laws, and are running iOS 26.2 or newer, certain media will not be visible in Ryuusei until you verify your age. You can check in Profile > Settings > General to see if you're impacted by this. (So far this is only Texas, but the number of regions will increase over time.)
