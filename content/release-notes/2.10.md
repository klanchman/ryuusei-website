This update adds new features and improvements:

- Browsing history! Ryuusei can now save all the items you view throughout the app so you can easily get back to them later
  - You can always see the most recent 5 items in your history, and Stargazer members can see a full 30 days of history
  - History is enabled by default, but you can limit what kinds of items are saved, or turn it off completely
- Songs now offer buttons to search Apple Music and Spotify when a direct link is not available
- The Search screen now always shows a paste button. You can paste AniList.co links to open them directly in Ryuusei, or quickly paste any text into the search box
  - This resolves an issue where sometimes the Apple paste button would not show up even when you had an AniList.co link copied
- Fix the Dashboard showing a blank screen when you have no items in progress
- Fix a crash that could occur when tapping the Songs button on Anime Detail
- Fix alignment issues on songs with long artist names
- Fix a rare issue where data would sometimes not load properly when launching the app

This update no longer supports iOS 16.
