This update adds new features and improvements:

- Push notifications have new alert sounds to choose from!
- The Dashboard allows sorting by number of new episodes available (I forgot to do this in the previous update!)
- When there are more than 5 items on your Dashboard and you sort by title (A to Z), an index will appear that allows quick scrolling based on titles
- Long-pressing a notification on the Notifications screen shows a context menu that allows you to go to more places than a normal tap (for example, if someone comments on a forum thread you're watching, you can open: the comment, the whole thread, or the other user's profile)
- Tapping a push notification opens the most relevant screen in the app (which screen that is depends on what the notification is about)
- The "Options" menu on push notifications includes a quick link to the in-app notification settings screen
- Data on the Notifications screen is automatically refreshed after a day or so (it was already automatically refreshed if you had unread notifications, but the screen could get out of date if you read notifications on a different device)

A future update will remove support for iOS 16. To continue getting updates to Ryuusei, please consider updating iOS if possible.
