This version of Ryuusei adds a highly requested feature, plus other improvements and fixes:

- The Dashboard now shows how many new episodes of currently airing anime are ready for you to watch
- On iOS 18, widget design is improved when using a tinted Home Screen
- On iPadOS 18, the tab bar is now at the top of the screen instead of the bottom
- The message shown when AniList.co is experiencing technical issues is easier to understand
- If errors occur immediately after launching (like if you don't have an internet connection, or AniList is experiencing technical issues), screens no longer incorrectly show "Log In" buttons
- Fixed a crash when opening an item from a widget (or ryuusei:// link) when the Profile tab is active
- Separator lines on Dashboard and List no longer disappear when refreshing

A future update will remove support for iOS 16. To continue getting updates to Ryuusei, please consider updating iOS if possible.
