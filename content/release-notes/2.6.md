This update adds push notifications for airing anime episodes, plus other improvements and bug fixes:

- Push notifications for airing anime episodes! Go to the Notifications tab to turn these on if you'd like. Tap the settings button in that tab to change whether the notifications make sound or light up the screen.
- Anime on your list in the "Plan to Watch" and "Paused" statuses now appear in the Airing Schedule widget. "Paused" anime episodes always appear, while only episode 1 of "Plan to Watch" anime appears. The widget also shows special indicators for anime in these statuses.
- Fix the Origin Region selector in advanced search showing abbreviations rather than full names
- Fix a crash when expanding More Information on media detail screens after following a deep link (such as from a widget, an AniList link, or the ryuusei:// URL scheme)
- Fix the synopsis and favorite status sometimes not showing correctly on media detail screens after following a deep link
