This update has a few improvements and fixes:

- You can now pull to refresh profile pages, and the Profile tab will refresh itself occasionally
- Added a "System Status" link in the Help screen where I can communicate about backend outages (you can also visit it directly: https://status.ryuusei.moe)
- Improved handling of errors if AniList is down or blocks your IP address
- Fixed a crash that could occur if logging in fails
