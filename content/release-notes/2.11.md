This is a small update, but it comes with a highly-requested feature, plus other improvements:

- Custom lists! Edit the custom lists an item is on by using the item's watching/reading status button. The Lists screen allows filtering items based on which custom lists they're on.
- Fixed web links in descriptions and biographies always opening a context menu when tapped
