This update has a few big new features (advanced search and rich text!), plus other smaller improvements and bug fixes:

- Advanced search! Use advanced search to find anime and manga based on season, genres, publishing status, region, whether it's already on your list, and more.
- Ryuusei now supports the majority of rich text formatting features on AniList! No more `<br>`, `~!spoilers!~`, and so on! Links that Ryuusei can open are opened directly in the app. Spoilers have first-class support, expanding inline when tapped.
- Titles and "more information" on anime, manga, staff, and character detail screens can now be copied! Long-press on the text to show the copy button.
- Discover Anime now has a section for "next season," and Discover Manga now has a section for "Trending"
- Character biographies are now included on character details pages. I had been holding off since those can have a lot of spoilers on them. Now that Ryuusei supports rich text, it was a great time to add character bios!
- The general design of the Discover page has been cleaned up
- Fixed a crash on newer versions of iPadOS 16 when trying to share a user profile
- Pressing the Favorite button on staff and character details now correctly asks you to log in if you aren't already
- Possible fix for a rare situation where cover images could show images belonging to the wrong item
- Incredibly minor tweak to navigation bar button alignment
