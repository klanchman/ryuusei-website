I'm excited to announce some big, often-requested features in this version Ryuusei:

- Push notifications for all AniList notifications! To enable them: go to the Notifications tab, press the settings button at the top of the screen, then turn on the "Push Notifications" switch. You can also customize push notifications based on what kind of notification you've received (such as mentions, replies, likes, etc.)
- Opening & ending song info for anime! Tap the "Songs" button on an Anime Detail screen to view the OPs and EDs for that anime. You can easily copy info like titles and artists, and find links to multiple music streaming services (when available).

Both of these features are available with Stargazer, a new in-app subscription. These new features require me to run a backend server, which costs me money on an ongoing basis.

Don't worry if in-app purchases aren't your thing! All existing features will remain free, and I'll continue adding new features for free as well.

Over time I'll be adding more features to Stargazer. I hope you'll give it a try!

This update also comes with changes to the app's [privacy policy]({{< ref "/legal/privacy" >}}) to account for the new backend server.
