Ryuusei can open links to AniList.co that are on your clipboard.

Data on your clipboard is not sent anywhere.

## v2 and Newer

Ryuusei only accesses the clipboard when you use one of the Paste buttons in the app.

## Before v2

When you open the app, you may see a notification that it pasted from the clipboard. (From iOS 16 onward, a confirmation dialog is shown.)

iOS only lets the app check that there is _some kind_ of link on the clipboard
without pasting. To see if the link is from AniList and something that it can open,
the app pastes.

If you'd rather the app not paste from the clipboard, you can go to Settings > General,
then turn off "Open Links on Clipboard."

If you are using iOS 16, please make sure you have Ryuusei v2 or newer for the best experience.
