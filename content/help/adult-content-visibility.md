Some content on AniList is tagged as "adult." Media like hentai/pornography and certain ecchi/erotica falls into this category. (Cover art on AniList is censored, but you may still wish to avoid seeing such content.)

Your account settings on AniList decide whether you can see such content, including in Ryuusei.

## How to Enable or Disable

Due to App Store guidelines, Ryuusei cannot provide an option to enable/disable adult content directly in the app.
Instead, you control this option on the AniList website.

To enable or disable adult content:

- Sign into [AniList.co](https://anilist.co)
- Go to your account settings and select Anime & Manga (or [follow this link](https://anilist.co/settings/media))
- Toggle the "18+ Content" checkbox on to see adult content if you're of age, or off to hide it
