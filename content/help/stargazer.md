## What is Stargazer?

Stargazer is a new in-app purchase for Ryuusei that gives you access to advanced features and supports development of Ryuusei.

## Why is Stargazer a subscription?

Many Stargazer features rely on running my own backend server. Running this server costs me money every month (in addition to the money I already spend every year to have Ryuusei in the App Store!). Making Stargazer a subscription ensures I have ongoing income to pay the ongoing costs of offering the features available in Stargazer.

## Is there a "lifetime" / one-time purchase option for Stargazer?

For the reasons above explaining why Stargazer is a subscription, there is not a one-time purchase option for Stargazer at this time.

## Are any features being removed from the free version of Ryuusei?

No, every feature that was available in Ryuusei before Stargazer remains free.

## Will Ryuusei continue getting new free features?

Yes. As time goes on I will add new features to Ryuusei that are free, while others will be available only to Stargazer members.

## I have a question that's not answered here

Please [contact me]({{% relref "/contact" %}}) and I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have!
