Ryuusei has widgets to show upcoming episodes of anime on your list, and can send notifications when they air.

## Which Episodes are Shown

Ryuusei uses these rules to show an episode in the widget and send a notification:

- If the anime is in the "Watching", "Rewatching", or "Paused" status on your list, any upcoming episode is shown
- If the anime is in the "Plan to Watch" status on your list, only episode 1 of the anime is shown

Otherwise, the anime is not shown.

Additionally, Ryuusei never shows ["adult" anime]({{<ref "adult-content-visibility" >}}) in upcoming episode widgets and notifications.
