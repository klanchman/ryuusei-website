+++

"Request Blocked" errors can happen for a couple of reasons:

- Most likely: AniList is experiencing technical problems
- Less likely: your IP address has been blocked by AniList

If you see a "Request Blocked" error in Ryuusei, you can do the following:
- Visit [AniList.co](https://anilist.co) in your web browser to see if it loads
- Check the [Ryuusei status page](https://status.ryuusei.moe) for known problems
- Check the #announcements channel in [AniList's official Discord](https://discord.com/invite/anilist) for known problems
  - If they mention the "API" is down, that means Ryuusei won't work correctly
