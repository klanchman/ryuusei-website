The stats on your profile, like total time watched, are calculated by AniList.co every 24~48 hours.
Sometimes, the site can get behind in its updates.

If this happens, you can try manually starting an update here: https://anilist.co/settings/lists
Click the “Update Stats” button toward the bottom of the page. Then keep an eye on your profile page on the AniList website. Whatever is shown there is what Ryuusei should show too.
