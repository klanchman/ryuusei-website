Some media on AniList is tagged as "adult." Media like hentai/pornography and certain ecchi/erotica falls into this category. (Cover art on AniList is censored, but you may still wish to avoid seeing such media.)

Your account settings on AniList decide whether you can see such media, including in Ryuusei.
Age verification laws in your region further decide whether you can see such media in Ryuusei.

## Enable or Disable on AniList

Due to App Store guidelines, Ryuusei cannot provide an option to enable/disable adult media directly in the app.
Instead, you control this option on the AniList website.

To enable or disable adult media:

- Sign into [AniList.co](https://anilist.co)
- Go to your account settings and select Anime & Manga (or [follow this link](https://anilist.co/settings/media))
- Toggle the "18+ Content" checkbox on to see adult media if you're of age, or off to hide it

## Age Verification

Some regions have laws requiring mobile apps to verify users' ages before making certain features available.

If age verification laws apply to you, and you are using iOS 26.2 or newer, Ryuusei will not show adult media by default.
Enabling adult media on your AniList account will show an option in Ryuusei to verify your age.

To check if this is the case for you, and to verify your age:

- Open Ryuusei
- Go to Profile > Settings > General
- Under the Adult Media section, press "Verify Your Age"
- Follow the instructions shown in Apple's popup, if it appears
- If you finish age verification, and you are old enough, Ryuusei will now show adult media

Age verification is performed by Apple. Ryuusei does not learn your birthdate or exact age. Instead, it only learns if you are within certain age ranges.
