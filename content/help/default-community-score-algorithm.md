title = "Default Community Score Algorithm"
+++

Ryuusei allows you to set your default community score algorithm.

"Community score" refers to the overall score shown for media, typically on the
detail page and in search results.

AniList has two different algorithms to calculate the community score: average and mean.

The "average" algorithm is a weighted average, and takes into account things like
the popularity of the media. The "mean" algorithm is strictly an arithmetic mean.

[This post on AniList](https://anilist.co/forum/thread/2845/1) has a little more
detail about the difference between the two scoring algorithms.
