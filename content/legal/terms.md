Use of the Ryuusei iOS app ("the App") is subject to [Apple's Licensed Application End User License Agreement](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/) and the following additional terms.

## Subscriptions

Some features of the App are billed on a subscription basis. If you choose to buy a subscription, payment will be charged to your Apple Account at the confirmation of purchase, or after the conclusion of a free trial if one is offered. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.

All purchases are final. I cannot issue refunds for purchases charged to your Apple Account. You may be able to get a refund from Apple following [their refund procedure](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223).

## Termination

I reserve the right to terminate a user's access to the App for violation of these terms or any other reason deemed appropriate.

## AniList

By using the App, you agree to AniList.co's [privacy policy and terms of use](https://anilist.co/terms).

## Changes to Terms

I may update these terms from time to time. I endeavor to notify users of updates, but may update the terms without prior notice. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the modified terms.
