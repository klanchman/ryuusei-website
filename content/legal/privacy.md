## The iOS App ("the App")

### Data Usage

Except as explained below, the App only sends data to AniList.co and my servers, and only in order to provide its functionality.

#### In-App Purchase Data

If you purchase a Stargazer subscription, data related to that in-app purchase is sent to my servers.
This data includes things like a transaction ID, transaction status, renewal preferences, etc.
In-app purchase data is used to provide Stargazer features on your devices.
This data is not linked to your identity or AniList.co account.

#### Diagnostic Data

The App sends diagnostic data to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for use by me to fix bugs or otherwise improve the App.
This data is not linked to your identity or AniList.co account.

Crash reports and other error logs may contain information such as what action you were trying to take when the problem occurred,
and actions that led up to the problem. Other diagnostic data may also be sent, including how long the App takes to launch
and how long screens take to load.

#### Contacting Support

When you contact me for support, I may receive information that allows me to locate your diagnostic and in-app purchase data in order to assist you.

### Your Account

When you log into your AniList.co account, the App receives a token to use to make requests on your behalf. The App never sees your AniList.co account password.
The token is stored securely on your device using Apple's [Keychain Services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services) API,
and is only transmitted to AniList.co for the purposes of authenticating requests.
If you ever wish to revoke a token granted to the App, you can do so on [the Apps page of your AniList settings](https://anilist.co/settings/apps).

### AniList.co's Privacy Policy

By using the App, you agree to AniList.co's [privacy policy and terms of use](https://anilist.co/terms).
