## The iOS App ("the App")

### Data Usage

Except as explained below, the App only sends data to AniList.co and my servers, and only in order to provide its functionality.

#### In-App Purchase Data

If you purchase a Stargazer subscription, data related to that in-app purchase is sent to my servers.
This data includes things like a transaction ID, transaction status, renewal preferences, etc.
In-app purchase data is used to provide Stargazer features on your devices.
This data is not linked to your identity or AniList.co account.

#### Diagnostic Data

The App sends diagnostic data to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for use by me to fix bugs or otherwise improve the App.
This data is not linked to your identity or AniList.co account.

Crash reports and other error logs may contain information such as what action you were trying to take when the problem occurred,
and actions that led up to the problem. Other diagnostic data may also be sent, including how long the App takes to launch
and how long screens take to load.

#### Contacting Support

When you contact me for support, I may receive information that allows me to locate your diagnostic and in-app purchase data in order to assist you.

#### Usage Data

The App sends usage data to [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com), a privacy-friendly analytics service. This usage
data helps me understand things like: which features of the app are used the most, which operating system and app versions
most people are using, and how I can improve the experience of using the app.

Usage data is not tied to your AniList.co user account or any other persistent identifier.

##### What data is transferred?

The data processed by TelemetryDeck is anonymized and does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about personal information.

The following data is collected, among other things:

- an anonymized, untraceable user ID (per app installation),
- actions defined by me (e.g., "app launched," "Stargazer upgrade screen shown"),
- a rounded timestamp (to the nearest hour),
- device metadata (e.g., system version, app version, device type).
- additional metadata defined by me (e.g., "why was the Stargazer upgrade screen shown?").

##### What is not stored?

- No IP addresses (not in logs, not in the database),
- no cookies or tracking technologies,
- no persistent identifiers that could be traced back to individuals (e.g. AniList.co user id / username).

Further information on TelemetryDeck privacy practices can be found at https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy and https://telemetrydeck.com/docs/guides/privacy-faq/.

### Your Account

When you log into your AniList.co account, the App receives a token to use to make requests on your behalf. The App never sees your AniList.co account password.
The token is stored securely on your device using Apple's [Keychain Services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services) API,
and is only transmitted to AniList.co for the purposes of authenticating requests.
If you ever wish to revoke a token granted to the App, you can do so on [the Apps page of your AniList settings](https://anilist.co/settings/apps).

### AniList.co's Privacy Policy

By using the App, you agree to AniList.co's [privacy policy and terms of use](https://anilist.co/terms).
